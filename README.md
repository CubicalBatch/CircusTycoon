# Circus Tycoon

## ABOUT THE GAME

Circus Tycoon puts you in the role of a circus manager for a 30-week season. Travel from city to city, hire talented performers, upgrade your tent, and put on unforgettable shows!

Each city has different audiences with unique preferences. Balance your ticket prices, manage your upkeep costs, and watch out for unexpected events that could make or break your business.

Can you build a renowned circus, manage your budget, and become the greatest showman before the 30-week season ends?

## HOW TO GET STARTED

**Controls:** Use arrow keys to navigate menus and ❎/🅾️ buttons to select/cancel.

**First Steps:**
1. You begin in the small town of Frisco with a basic tent, a clown troupe, and $500.
2. Start by running a show! From the main menu, select "Run Show."
3. Set your ticket price (start around $5-8) and press "Start the Show."
4. After your show, review your profits and audience feedback.
5. As you earn money, hire more acts from the "Manage Acts" menu.
6. When demand drops in a city, travel to a new location from the "Cities" menu.

**Pro Tips:**
- Different cities have different favorite act types (shown on the city info screen)
- Hire acts that match city preferences for attendance bonuses
- Act skills improve with each performance, increasing your show quality. You can also pay money to train them.
- Upgrade your tent to host more acts and larger audiences
- Don't wait too long to move cities - once demand drops too low, attendance suffers
- Manage your money carefully - bankruptcy ends your game!

Make as much money as possible over a 30-week season without going bankrupt. Good luck!
